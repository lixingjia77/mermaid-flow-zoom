# Mermaid Flow Zoom

Mermaid Flow Zoom improves rendered Mermaid diagrams in Obsidian with zooming, panning, resizing, and fullscreen viewing.

## Features

- Mouse wheel zooms around the pointer.
- Drag to pan the diagram.
- Trackpad horizontal scrolling, `Shift` + wheel, or wheel near the left/right edge pans horizontally.
- Toolbar controls for zoom in, zoom out, reset, and fullscreen.
- Reset and first render fit the complete Mermaid SVG proportionally and center it in the container.
- Desktop container resizing from the lower-right corner.
- Mobile one-finger pan and two-finger pinch zoom.
- Works with dynamically rendered Mermaid diagrams in Reading view and Live Preview where Obsidian exposes rendered SVGs.
